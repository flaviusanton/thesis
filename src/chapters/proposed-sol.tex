\chapter{Proposed Solution}
\label{chapter:proposed-sol}

\todo{Overview of this chapter. Focus on the fact that the system is algorithm
agnostic. It can basically do any type of image computation.}

\section{Requirements and Technologies Used}
\todo{Explain what were the requirements, i.e.
* the system has to be written in Scala (Hootsuite requirement)
* has to be very easy to scale horizontally
* has to offer a simple/fast way of introducing a new logo to the database
* has to store the positive images to a database and annotate them with the
  found logo}

\subsection{Kafka -- A Messaging System}

\todo{Talk about general Kafka architecture, why is it good in this situation}
\subsection{Scala}
\todo{General stuff about Scala. Advantages/disadvantages}

\section{System Architecture}

\todo{Prepare the next subsections}

\subsection{Fetch Module}
\todo{Explain how images are fetched from the Social Network, how do we store
them. How are they passed to the next components etc.}

\subsection{Detector Module}
\todo{Explain how does a detector work. Where it pulls data from. Focus on the
fact that detectors are algorithm agnostic}

\subsection{Annotated Data Storage Module}
\todo{Where is data stored. How is it stored. How do we pull data from the
database}
\subsection{Queing System}
\todo{Explain how messages get passed around. Talk about message types. What
data do we send. How do components fetch images without sending them around.}

\subsection{Data Flow}
\todo{Talk on a diagram that explains the complete dataflow}

\section{Logo Recognition Algorithm}
\todo{Explain the algorithm. Talk about the general idea. Why is it good in
our situation.}
