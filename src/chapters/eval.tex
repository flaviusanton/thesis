\chapter{Testing and Evaluation}

\todo{Prepare the next sections. Explain why they are relevant for system
evaluation}

\section{Algorithm Performance}
\todo{Present some numbers of how fast the algorithm is.}

\section{Cost and Resource Consumption}
\todo{Do an estimation of how many machines the system needs in order to be
effective (i.e. do not fall behind of social media streaming endpoints).
Resource consumption etc.}

\section{Precision and Recall}

\subsection{Precision and Recall in Pattern Recognition}
\todo{General stuff about precision and recall. Why are they a good benchmark}

\subsection{Precision and Recall for our Algorithm}
\todo{Do an evaluation based on a table with precision/recall for our
algorithm}

\section{Scalability and Portability}
\todo{Talk about how easy to scale the system is. How portable it can be etc}
