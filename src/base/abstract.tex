% This file contains the abstract of the thesis

In this thesis we propose a pipelined, distributed system that allows
processing of images originating from online social networks in order to
recognize logos and build statistics upon them with the general purpose of
enriching an existing social media analytics platform. Therefore, we have built
several stand-alone components logically organized as a processing pipeline
and communicating with each other using messages. The logo recognition
algorithm used in this implementation is based on pattern matching and has
been tested on images coming from the Twitter public stream.
